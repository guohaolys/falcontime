Rapid response messages
These messages are used for the actual synchronization, and must be turned around immediately. All other communication is done with the non-realtime messages.

These messages will use port 10320 UDP

unsigned int implies 32-bit big endian number

Time Request Message (client -> server) - 8B
unsigned int message_id -> 1 (Time Request)
unsigned int client_id -> predetermined value of the client

Time Response Message (server -> client) - 16B
unsigned int message_id -> 2 (Time Response)
unsigned int client_id -> predetermined value of the client
unsigned int seconds -> seconds since start
unsigned int nanoseconds -> Nanoseconds since last second rollover

Narrowing Time Message (client -> server) - 24B
unsigned int message_id -> 10 
unsigned int client_id
unsigned int seconds_received
unsigned int nanoseconds_received

Non-realtime messages
These messages are used for all the non-rapid response buisness that needs to be passed between the client and server. When each client comes up they initiate a TCP socket on port 10320 (or TLS socket on port 10321?) and keep this open for the duration of the session. If this connection is lost for any reason the client must start a new one, re-activate, and re-join any groups.

unsigned int implies 32-bit big endian number
double implies ieee double precision floating point number
